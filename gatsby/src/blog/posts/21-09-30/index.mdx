Hello again. I am back and I have some excellent news to share with anyone who dares to be anyone in Waterdeep! The construction of Minor Manor (get it, we used to call ourselves the Minor Solutions!?) is finally wrapping up! Also, everyone from the adventure party seems to be back in town. This is so exciting, and I cannot wait to catch up with everyone and debut their newly learned skills to the community. We are hosting a garden party on the grounds of a very own manor. Bong spent a significant amount of his year back at the monastery reconnecting with his tradition and picked up a traveling tea cart along the way! He has graciously offered to supply his superb tea blends to our guests at the party.
