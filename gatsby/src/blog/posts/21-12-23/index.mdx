So during our break we were able to decern that this portal leads to the air plane. We don't know much about this place, but we can assume that there is lots of _AIR_. The druid comes through again! When we sneak back to the portal, Varis wild shapes into a giant eagle. We all use some rope to tie ourselves to his body and count on him navigate us through. The only info we were really able to gather was that we needed to find someone who resides in the Great Storm. Neat.

Once we are through the portal, can see a massive thunder head cloud way in the distance. It seems pretty intuitive to just kind of head that way. However, we can see pretty quickly that this is going to take ages... Long too long after we are hopelessly flying through this endless sky, we are greeted by an air elemental. Nice dude. Mostly see through. But he is able to direct us to some air currents that will make this trip sooo much faster. The elemental uses the gentle force of its own air presence to direct the feathers on Varis's wings. Once we hit an air stream, we begin making breathtaking speeds towards out destination.

We get as close as this stream will take us then exit towards the storm - which soon makes itself known. The rumbles of thunder begin to get louder and louder as lightening strikes get dangerously close. This soon becomes a treacherous environment as we are met with another type of wind that is making it extremely hard for Varis to control his dodges from the lightening. Now it's my time to shine! I equip my trusty Ollamp harp and begin to concentrate on Control Weather. I am able to reduce the force of the wind as well as alter it direction to help boost us closer to our goal.

A few minutes later we come to the eye of this storm which opens up to reveal a giant citadel on a floating mountain. I will save you small talk, but basically we are taken to a djinn in a beautiful structure. _(that a can clearly tell is being doctored with some transmutation magic, At least they have good design style even if they are cheating.)_ Here we explain what we had learned about some chaos taking place in this plane that is being caused by a group known as the **Iron Legion**.

> "They Iron Legion is a thorn in my side. They are spoken of like the boogey man. A friend of mine mentioned that something similar is happening in the fire plane as well."

This is when he mumbles something about Aella and a prophecy. _Excuse us... What??_

> "Four would come together to make a forge of the four elements. It is all that is, all that can be. At the center would be four people and only they can control it. It is an object of great power, The Forge, built atop the elemental nexis. The prophecy claims foretold of an imbalance in good and evil. I believe this is what we are seeing take place with the Iron Legion. I am going to have to send you there... I recommend you take a rest first. I'd hate to send you into your doom without a fighting chance.‚Äù

We sleep and we are preparing for the day in the morning, we are presented with a bright purple flash of light and we feel our bodies rushing in what can only be a form of travel though none of us have really experienced this exact method of transportation. This is when we arrive on a sort of island with strange large stones with colored energy. In the center there is a blackened crystal with pink swirling energy and shadowy tendrils coming out of it. _(This is probably Nexis if I've ever seen one...)_ The shadowy tendrils attach themselves to four humanoid bodies that are chained down. They all appear unconscious and dehydrated. They appear to be decaying, but they ar also breathing. One of them is Aella's missing grandfather!
