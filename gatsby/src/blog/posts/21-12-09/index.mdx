#### I just knew that house party would pay off! Let me tell you where we have been the last few days!

I overheard some gossip about a well known family home - which also happens to be owned by Aella's (our party's Air Genasi Ranger) estranged family. There have been whispers about a servant found dead a few weeks ago, and since then passersby have reported hearing an odd whistling sound coming from the property. Of course we had to investigate.

The next week, the whole town would be celebrating the Fae Festival, so we decided to use the extravagant celebrations to our advantage.

#### -Disguises!

For those who are stumbling on this blog for the first time, let me so a brief introduction of our individual party members. (Of course more info can be found on [our site](https://criticalreactions.gtsb.io/meet-the-party))

- **Aella**, an air genasi. Again, is the party's ranger. She dressed as a joyful jester!
- **Bong**, a tortle and a monk. He dressed as a satyr _With the help of illusion magic of course_.
- **Lyra**, a half-elf and a Wild Magic sorcerer...dressed as nude as publicly is allowed. When asked what she was attempting to be, she finally stumbled upon **_"A Siren! ?"_** -shrug- She pulled it off.
- **Varis**, a drow and a druid. He wild shaped into a black cat.
- And I, **Althea**, a high elf and lore bard. I was an exemplary dryad.

We spent a short amount of time at the festival enjoying it's provisions. We acquire some fine mead, and I buy a exquisite fake jewel encrusted tiara. _You never know when you will need to bribe a greedy chump_

Then we attempt to sneak away towards the Picazo house as dusk is beginning to take hold of the city. When we arrive, we find wo guards making slow patrols around the property. Lyra uses her _"siren"_ costume and a bottle of mead to distract on of them and lure him out of view of a foot path tht leads into the back of the house. Meanwhile, Varis, the stray, is scoping out the house itself to see if there are more guards to deal with inside.

We end up investigating the house with almost no issues until we follow that whistling sound into the basement. that was when we found within an old servants kitchen - _A MASSIVE SWIRLING TYPHOON OF A PORTAL_. Oh wow. We did not prepare for this, so we sneak back out, and head home to prepare for travel and gather some intel.
