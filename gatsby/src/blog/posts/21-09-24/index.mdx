We have spent the last year on a business hiatus while the party members ventured off to tie up lose ends or dedicate serious time to learning a new skill. I mostly stayed behind in Waterdeep fixing the clerical errors of this business that fell into my lap - Bill's Storage. The previous owner was greedy. We needed a place to store some suspicious constructs that fell into our possession and he was asking too many questions and trying to take advantage of our desperate situation, so I offered him a deal he could not refuse: to pull from the Deck of Many Things instead of contracting a payment plan. Let's just say, we needed to another storage unit now for his lifeless shell. Anyways, I have also been able to spend some time training staff so that I do not have to bound to the premises everyday. So far, we are making a small, but steady profit!

Before we all of us in the party split ways for a small break from saving the world, everyone chipped in some coin towards a plot of land and the assembly of a modestly sized manor. Since I am the only one who seems to be around these days, I am the director of these operations as well! It is draining having such a charismatic and authoritative spirit. I am dedicating every last extra ounce of charm left in me to try and build my relationships with the community's movers and shakers. You can never have too many allies in high places. I think this is going to benefit us all greatly very soon! Stay tuned!
