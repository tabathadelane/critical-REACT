#### The Dazzling Althea Moonbrooke and company, request the honor of your presence for a Manor-warming mixer this weekend.

This is be the event of the season for all of the most distinguished residents of Waterdeep. You do not want to miss this!

_I_ do not want you to miss this.

Seriously, you owe us. It's the least you can do after we have saved this city, and frankly the whole realm, from chaos and destruction and misery time at least half a dozen times. Honestly, some of you paid for this place, so please come and enjoy it with me.

See you there!
